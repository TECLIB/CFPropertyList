 * The PHP implementation of Apple's PropertyList can handle XML PropertyLists
 * as well as binary PropertyLists. It offers functionality to easily convert
 * data between worlds, e.g. recalculating timestamps from unix epoch to apple
 * epoch and vice versa. A feature to automagically create (guess) the plist
 * structure from a normal PHP data structure will help you dump your data to
 * plist in no time.
